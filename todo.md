- A real test suite!!!
- "stop other scripts in sprite" should stop waiting sounds
- Apply proper viewbox offset to SVG skin rotation centers (done)
- Draw pen lines with instancing (no longer planned; tested and has no performance benefit)
- Really small sprites should trigger "touching" blocks (see: griffpatch's Ball Physics Scroll v0.4)
- Clones' audio shouldn't stop playing on clone deletion, and clone sounds should cut off other clones' sounds
  - Tricky because we don't want to leak a bunch of audio nodes
  - We can't share the AudioTarget between all clones because the effects are distinct
- Revamp block introspection API
    - want to be able to type ctx.evaluate properly
    - specify "only accept blocks returning X"
- Switch the renderer over to 2x3 matrices
- Promise-throwing stuff for async reporters
